# Set

## Introduction

You've seen them before and you enjoyed them a lot. Sets are back to stay! The same principles that we learn in math will be applied to sets in programming, and that's because they're so awesome to only be part of math.

## Definition

Set is a data structure that lets you store all kind of values without paying attention to the order in which they are stored. You'll like and resent them a lot because of that characteristic.

You may be familiar with lists (arrays), but it's worth noticing that sets are different from lists. Sets allow no duplicates and have no order. If you try to add a duplicate, sets will just ignore what you just did and keep only one of the instances. With the order, it will only care of keeping the things in the set without paying attention to the order. So, if you care about the order of the things you're storing, don't use sets.

## Hashing

Sets can store many things and perform operations to check and retrieve values in O(1). That's something that doesn't happen in a list, where an operation like that would be O(n). To get that efficiency, sets use hashing.
